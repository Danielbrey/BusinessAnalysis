# BusinessAnalysis - School Supplies

Imagine a school supplies business SuppliesRUs, has two stores. They currently have two suppliers for the three products that they sell: staplers, scissors, and tape. Supplier A offers staplers and scissors, and Supplier B offers tape. Suppliers ship the products directly to the stores. Each supplier ships to each of the two stores, so 4 total shipments are made each week.

Beginning 8/3/2015, SuppliesRUs would like to start selling glue sticks. SuppliesRUs must pay for shipping costs from the supplier to their stores. The glue sticks would be shipped with the other items from the suppliers. Both suppliers make glue sticks and have given the prices to supply their glue sticks to SuppliesRUs:
- Supplier A charges $0.80 per glue stick.
- Supplier B charges $0.77 per glue stick.

For shipping, SuppliesRUs has two choices in carriers from each supplier and can use one or both carriers each week. They always use the cheapest carrier for a given origin-destination pair. 
- Carrier X charges a flat rate per shipment.
- Carrier Y charges a variable rate per pound.
- Both carriers can fit up to 45,000 pounds per shipment.

SuppliesRUs expects that glue stick orders will be the same as stapler orders. SuppliesRUs also expects that orders for all of its products will grow 15% year over year. They must decide which supplier to choose for supplying its glue sticks for the next year.
